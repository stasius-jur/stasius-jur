Professional Journey from Technical Customer Success to Data Analytics

As a former Senior Technical Customer Success Manager, I had the privilege of refining my skills in the IT sector while collaborating with some of the world's most prestigious organizations, including the World Health Organization, the United Nations, and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. These experiences honed my ability to manage complex projects and deliver impactful solutions at a global scale.

Driven by a desire to explore new horizons, I made a strategic transition into the field of Data Analytics, aligning my career with my growing passion for data-driven decision-making. After completing an intensive 1,120-hour training program, I am now a dedicated Data Analyst. This new role allows me to merge my curiosity about business operations with the power of analytics, helping organizations unlock new opportunities and achieve greater success through data.
